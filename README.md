sprockets-rake
==============

Rake tasks commonly used for compiling assets using sprockets in rack apps. I recommend using guard[https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=guard+ruby] and guard-rake[https://github.com/rubyist/guard-rake] so you can run the task in the background when a file is modified.
